# Installation

Make sure you have PHP 7 available on the machine you want to run the profiler. 

## XHProf

XHProf is used by the profiler to collect data while your scripts are running. You will have to manually compile and 
install this extension.

### Prepare your environment

#### On MacOS

To make things easy, we strongly encourage you to use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/). It will let you install the most 
recent PHP version and development tools you will need to compile the extension.

```bash
brew install php72
brew link --force php72
```

#### On Debian

On Debian, PHP and the development tools are available as two distinct packages. 

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install php-dev
```

#### On RHEL

On RHEL, PHP and the development tools are also available as two distinct packages. 

```bash
yum install php-devel
```

### Compile the extension

A new version of XHProf has been published by the cool guys at [Tideways](https://tideways.io/). It is available on 
[Github](https://github.com/tideways/php-xhprof-extension).

Compiling and enabling this extension is really easy:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tideways/php-xhprof-extension.git /tmp/php-xhprof-extension
cd !$

phpize
./configure
make
make install
```

_Depending on your OS, you might get permission errors when running `make install`: sometimes it needs to be run as root._

Now that the PHP extension is compiled, you will have to manually enable it. Find your PHP configuration directory using 
this command:

```bash
php -i | grep 'Scan this dir for additional .ini files' | grep -oE '[^ ]*$'
```

Now let's create the configuration file for the XHProf extension and see if it works:

```bash
echo "extension=tideways_xhprof.so" | tee $(php -i | grep 'Scan this dir for additional .ini files' | grep -oE '[^ ]*$')
php -m | grep xhprof
```

You should see `tideways_xhprof` in the output if everything went fine. If it's OK, you are now ready to profile.

## PHP library

The PHP library will be used in the application you want to profile. The only installation method is [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/).

```bash
composer require --dev jubianchi/prof-it
```

## Client application

To analyze the results of your profiling sessions, you will need the client application. It will let you open the 
profiles and navigate trough them.

### On MacOS

The client application is available as a _DMG_ image. Download the latest version from the Github 
[Releases page](https://github.com/jubianchi/prof-it/releases).

**Be sure to download the latest version.**

Now mount the image and copy the application to your _Applications_ folder.

### On Debian

The client application is available as a _deb_ package. Download the latest version from the Github 
[Releases page](https://github.com/jubianchi/prof-it/releases).

**Be sure to download the latest version.**

Now open the file by double-clicking on it and your package manager should guide you through the installation process.

### On RHEL

The client application is available as a _rpm_ package. Download the latest version from the Github 
[Releases page](https://github.com/jubianchi/prof-it/releases).

**Be sure to download the latest version.**

Now open the file by double-clicking on it and your package manager should guide you through the installation process.

_Depending on your distro, you might get errors when installing the package (something about unsupported OS). If you 
run through this issue, use the following command to install the application:_

```bash
yum install lsb libXScrnSaver
rpm -i --ignoreos prof-it-*.x86_64.rpm
```
